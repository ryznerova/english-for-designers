# Hi, I'm Zuzana! 🌸

Hiii

My name is Zuzana and I'm a graphic designer. I'm also an illustrator, which means that in my design, I like to use illustrations.
I'm currently finishing my Bachelor studies at the Prague School of Creative Communication.
I work as a graphic designer for Bonami - a Czech company that sells furniture and decorations. 
In my free time, I create digital paintings in Procreate.
