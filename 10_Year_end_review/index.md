# Year End Review

### 1) What did you like most about this course?

The opportunity to talk in English. I don't really have many chances to speak in English, so I really appreciate it when I can.

### 2) What did you like least about this course?

For me, this semester was really stressful and I needed to concentrate on finishing my bachelor's thesis. And it felt like we were getting more time-consuming work the more the closer the end of the semester was getting. So instead of focusing on the thesis, I had to work on the last assignments and it made me even more stressed. It felt like we had less work in the previous semester, which is kind of inconvenient, since we had more free time, than this semester.

### 3) What were the top (three) things you learned this year?

First of all, I learned how to use GitHub.
Then I got better at making presentations.
And lastly, making all the presentations made me deepen my vocabulary.

### 4) What was the most memorable activity/assignment?

For me, it was definitely storytelling, because I had the most fun working on it üòÜ.

### 5) What‚Äôs something you accomplished this year that you are most proud of?

Finishing my bachelor's thesis!

### 6) What‚Äôs one thing you learned about yourself?

I found out, that I rarely prepare myself for presentations and that I am improvising too much. Which can sometimes lead to me looking lost.

### 7) What‚Äôs one thing you could have done better?

I think I should have made more time for all of the tasks. And I definitely should have worked regularly.

### 8) What‚Äôs one thing I could have done better?

As I mentioned earlier, the way the workload was spread throughout the semester could have been different. So more work in the winter semester, and less work in the summer. Otherwise, I really enjoyed the lessons ‚ù§Ô∏è.

### 9) What‚Äôs one thing you would add or change about this course?

I think it would be nice to do more work in teams. And mixing those teams to get to know each other's work. I believe you noticed, how we were kind of divided, so maybe it would be nice to mix it up üñ§.

### 10) What advice would you give to students taking this course next year?

Please, write down stuff. Don't be like me. Don't improvise everything, because you're going to have more work.
