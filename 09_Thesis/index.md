# Fragnerka

In my bachelor thesis, I'm focusing on the unification of visual elements with marketing communication for Jaroslav Fragner Gallery. One of the reasons why I chose this gallery is that its main theme is architecture, which I studied for three years. So I wanted to combine my knowledge of graphic design with architecture.

I've known this gallery for years and throughout the years I've been noticing, that not many people know about this gallery, even though it is located in the historic center of Prague. Whenever I went to see an exhibition, no one was there. I feel like it is a waste of opportunity because there are not that many galleries, that are focused on architecture. So I decided to come up with a new solution.

![1](14_01.jpg)

First I chose an institution with a program that was very similar to Jaroslav Fragner Gallery – CAMP (Center for Architecture and Metropolitan Planning). Then I checked many galleries around the Czech Republic, to see how they communicate. There was one gallery, that stood out and it became my source of inspiration. It is 8smička with its fully united communication. 8smička is a gallery, that is located in a small town, yet it is known all around the Czech Republic.

After finding my inspiration, I started working. First I changed the gallery to a cultural center with a new name – Fragnerka. It is shorter and it sounds younger. Then I chose a targeted group – students. Jaroslav Fragner Gallery belongs to ČVUT, where you can study architecture. So I want Fragnerka to work closely with ČVUT. It could be part of the studies to visit the center. A lot of teachers would be willing to work with Fragnerka – lectures, workshops. 

After these changes, I started to work on the visuals. First I created a logo and a logo symbol. So the logo is typographic and it is written in a font called General Sans, which I later chose for the whole communication. The logo symbol is a letter F composed of geometric shapes that refer to architecture. The logo symbol is much more robust, so it's easily recognized from farther away. The logo and the symbol are never used together. For example in publications logo is on the front of the book and the logo symbol is on the spine. My goal for the logo was to create something that can be flexible. You can see it in the logo and logo symbol for FragnerKafé (a café in Fragnerka). The logo symbol was created by reshaping the letter F, so it looks like a cup.

Then I chose the color palette. I wanted something youthful that would also refer to architecture. So as a main color, I chose red which refers to bricks. It is combined with blue (refers to the color of a pen), green (refers to urbanism), and white (refers to paper).

For the font, I picked General Sans that I've used for the logo. It is a very flexible font, that can be used for titles but also longer texts in publications.

Lastly, I came up with the concept of editing photos. Exhibiting architecture is all about photos, so I used them a lot in communication. To edit the photos, I use gradients, shapes, and patterns and then I create these collages.

Here you can see,  how these elements can be used in graphics. For example on tickets, invitations, brochures, and merchandising.

Now I'm going to talk about publications. Jaroslav Fragner Gallery publishes quite a lot of publications, but they don't pay that much attention to them. So they are not very engaging. I want Fragnerka to keep publishing, but focus more on the design. Here you can see, how I'm using the same elements, that I chose for the brand.

The main goal of the new campaign is to raise awareness of Fragnerka and to increase the number of visitors. The first step was the change of program. Instead of just exhibitions, Fragnerka also offers lectures, workshops, commented strolls around Prague, and much more. Then it was engaging ČVUT in this program.

Jaroslav Fragner Gallery doesn't communicate online or in print. So the next step is to be active on social media and to post posters around Prague and in ČVUT. There is one thing, that I don't want to change about their current communication. And that is selling their publications in bookstores. I believe this is the right way to catch the attention of more people.
