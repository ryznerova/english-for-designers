# Voice & Tone

## Voice

- I want my voice to sound confident, professional but with a hint of humor.
- I want to treat my client with respect.
- I want to keep the text short, easy to read.

## Tone

- Educated - I want to look like I know what I’m talking about, but I don’t want to use jargon.
- Formal - I want to be professional, not overly friendly.
- Frank - I want to take the client through the whole process. Show the way I didn’t choose, so the client knows, why I chose the final design.
- Confident - I want to look like I’m proud of the work I’m presenting, but I don’t want to look like a know-it-all.

## Style

- I write for my client – I avoid jargon or slang, so it’s easy for my client to understand.
- I have clear hierarchy of information - headline, bullet points, the rest is said.
- I use active voice - the subject of the sentence does the action.
- I am proud of my work - I don’t use any negative descriptions of my work.
- I am polite - but with a hint of humor.
